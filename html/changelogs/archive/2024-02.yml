  Chlorotrifluoride:
  - imageadd: added two new eyes, "wide" and "big"
  miguelop1:
  - rscadd: Added new epic emote (*mew)
2024-02-05:
  CEO of Mememotes:
  - rscadd: 'Added attorney-flavored emotes for when you REALLY need to throw an objection:
      *objection, *holdit, *takethat (incl. *objection0 which is without voice. You
      can set custom catchphrase by writing text after the objection emotes or similar,
      but it will be always lower-case). Plus *realize, *nani, *smirk2, *sl@ves, *assback,
      *sorryfor (gachis) and *2099 (if - god forbid - a canon event happens).'

  ariaworld:
  - rscdel: Old lavaland_old.dmm file (unused, bad practice), rename lavaland_novaya.dmm
      to Lavaland.dmm, as it includes Xenoarcheology on it's 2nd Z-Level.
  - refactor: Welder tank explosion code, to stop infinitely-looping null explosions
      and therefore spam-log for admins.
2024-02-16:
  ariaworld:
  - tweak: Stop Cryptocurrency miners from beeping every second.
  - rscadd: Ports Sleep healing from TG (doesn't replace medicine, slow, works when
      character is above 75% health and amplified by conditions such as having a bed
      and a bedsheet / chairs and tables work, albeit give a lesser bonus).
  - rscadd: Restorative Metabolism quirk (also works for robotic biotypes, except
      for healing corruption, for balance purposes).
  - rscadd: Breathless quirk (took away from undead).
  - rscadd: 'Buns of Thunder quirk: makes your butt extremely satisfying to smack,
      as well as dealing some stamina damage (which has a cooldown). Ported from CB
      and made even better with SPLURT love.'
  - rscadd: Reset Layer Priority button in IC tab.
  - tweak: You can now layershift from -26 to +26, and easily reset the layer back
      to 0. This is very useful for ERP, especially with people who are laying down
      (their layer is set to -21).
  - balance: Undead quirk is available again, no longer has cold resistance, OP regeneration
      and no-breath.
  - balance: Movement and niche quirks such as Freerunner, Quick Step, Empath, and
      Skittish's cost have been reduced, because of their value-to-cost ratio.
  - tweak: 'Body Morpher quirk: tweak placement of update_body() calls.'
  - tweak: Voracious quirk description now tells you that you won't be sad because
      of fat. Incubus and Succubus users don't suffer the drawbacks of being fat,
      but can still appear so on examine (360 units of cum per orgasm instantly made
      them obese).
  - tweak: Bloodsucker Fledgeling can now revive outside of coffins, and the quirk
      has been moved to good.dm , the revival ability was quite useless, and is actually
      balanced as it dangerously sets the user's nutrition back to 0, and contains
      many checks for it's use.
  - bugfix: Alot text warnings and mood events and refactor some quirk on-examine
      process names.
  - tweak: Custom material tiles now show the "Material" prefix before their crafting
      recipe, to avoid confusion.
  rin1l1:
  - rscadd: Fermi expansion chems (breast/penis/butt) to universal genital fluid whitelist
  - rscadd: Fermi reduction chems to universal genital fluid whitelist
  - rscadd: AphrodisiacPlus (Hexacrocin) to universal genital fluid whitelist
2024-02-28:
  CSDSP:
  - tweak: Allow custom shuttles to move after round end
  - tweak: Allow navigation consoles to see gigabeacons in CentCom after round end
  ariaworld:
  - tweak: Updates headshot input box to inform on how to make Discord links work.
  - rscdel: Removed unused and abandoned Extools from ref-tracking to allow Coders
      to go through reference tracking with less hurdles.
